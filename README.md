## Who Art Thou?

I am **Abdeljalil El Filaly**, a humble **Full-Stack Developer**, well-versed in the arcane arts of code and system craft.

Lo, I am but a humble **Full-Stack Developer**, well-versed in the arcane arts of code and system craft. My journey hath led me through many a perilous path, wherein I have honed my skills in the following disciplines:

- **Frontend Sorcery:** React, TypeScript, Angular
- **Backend Alchemy:** NestJS, Express.js, Ruby on Rails, Laravel
- **Tomes of Knowledge (Databases):** MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **The Clouds Above & Machines Beneath (Cloud & DevOps):** AWS (S3, API Gateway, Cognito, EC2), Docker, Docker Compose
- **Divining the Mysteries of Data (Business Intelligence):** Talend, Power BI

I now tread the halls of **Youcode UM6P**, where I sharpen mine skills in the **MERN stack**, having once wielded the powers of Laravel in days past.

## Deeds & Endeavors
- **PayTime:** A ledger most noble, wherein one may lend or borrow coin without need for enchanted tokens or gilded scrolls.
- **The Garage of Many Gears:** A sanctum for the mending of chariots and the keeping of mechanical relics.
- **The Guild of Deliverance:** A great system of sustenance, where orders be placed, feasts prepared, and swift riders dispatched.

## Interests of the Soul
Know this, weary wanderer—mine heart doth burn with fervor for the **game development arts**, and I ever seek to master its secrets.
